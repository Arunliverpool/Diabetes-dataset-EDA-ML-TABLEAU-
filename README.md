# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction & Analysis with Machine Learning and Tableau

## Overview

This project explores and predicts diabetes occurrence using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and interactive visual analytics with Tableau. The workflow demonstrates a complete data science pipeline from raw data to actionable insights and model evaluation.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features:** Age, Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Outcome (diabetes: 0/1)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn):

- **Missing Values:** Checked and handled (imputed zeros or missing values for key features).
- **Distribution Analysis:** Plotted histograms and boxplots for Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Visualized relationships between features (correlation heatmap).
- **Outcome Proportion:** Compared feature distributions between diabetic (Outcome=1) and non-diabetic (Outcome=0) groups.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created age bins, normalized features, and explored relationships (e.g., Age vs. Glucose, BMI by Outcome).

## Machine Learning Models

Trained and evaluated multiple supervised ML algorithms using scikit-learn:

- **Logistic Regression**
  Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness as a baseline model for binary classification problems like diabetes prediction.
- **Random Forest**
  Selected for its ability to model complex, non-linear relationships and handle feature interactions, often resulting in strong predictive performance.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  Used for its robustness to high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in finding the optimal decision boundary between classes.



**Pipeline:**
- Split data into training and test sets
- Feature scaling/normalization as appropriate
- Model fitting and hyperparameter tuning (grid search where relevant)
- Generated predictions and prediction probabilities

## Model Performance Metrics

Evaluated each model using key metrics:

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision (Diab) | Recall (Diab) | F1 (Diab) | ROC-AUC |
|----------------------|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.73     | 0.60             | 0.70          | 0.65      | 0.82    |
| Random Forest        | 0.76     | 0.63             | 0.74          | 0.68      | 0.83    |
| SVM                  | 0.71     | 0.56             | 0.76          | 0.65      | 0.80    |

- **Confusion Matrix:**
This analysis helps understand not just overall accuracy, but also which type of error is more common (e.g., is the model missing actual diabetes cases, or is it over-predicting diabetes?).

- **ROC Curve:**  
  Computed and plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for each classifier, measuring the tradeoff between the true positive rate (sensitivity/recall) and the false positive rate across different thresholds. The **Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC)** quantifies model discrimination: a higher AUC means better ability to distinguish between diabetics and non-diabetics. This provides an evaluation metric that is less sensitive to class imbalance.

- **Error Analysis:**  
Calculated and visualized the total counts of **false positives** and **false negatives** for each model, both numerically and via bar charts in Tableau. This deeper error analysis is essential for real-world health applications, as the cost of misclassifying a diabetic patient (FN) is very different from the cost of a false positive. By comparing error types across models, we can select the model that best balances sensitivity and specificity for the intended use case.

## Results & Insights

- Random Forest achieved the highest overall performance based on ROC AUC and F1 Score.
- Glucose and BMI are the most significant predictors of diabetes in the dataset.
- Error analysis shows [example: SVM had more false negatives, while Logistic Regression had more false positives].
- Tableau dashboard provides an interactive platform for further exploration and communication of findings.
